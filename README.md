# Algotrasoft Community

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.2.

On the homepage, users can find a wealth of information about the community and its activities. Users can access the scanner page by registering from the sign up page. On the scanner page, users can view the results of the Ross Hook strategy backtest for over 1000 symbols. These results include the stock name and the yearly annual percentage yield (APY). If users want to see more detailed information about the results, such as the sector, market capitalization, and backtest results for 1, 3, and 6 months, they can click on the result card. To achieve this, mock data for the backtest results was created and deployed on Firebase. This allowed the development of an API to retrieve the results of the algorithm strategy. The live project was deployed using Firebase.
